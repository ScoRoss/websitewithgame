        <h1>BabylonJS Game Development Project</h1>
        <p>This project serves as a demonstration of my learning in game development using BabylonJS.</p>
        
        <p>I encountered several challenges during the development process, particularly with implementing the scoring system. Overcoming these challenges has deepened my understanding of game mechanics and programming with BabylonJS.</p>

        <p>I would like to express my gratitude to the person grading this project for their time and feedback.</p>
